libjrdp
=======

libjrdp is part of the jRDP project. Our goal is to implement the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) in Java. Yes, we're talking about the RDP as specified by Microsoft. The `mstsc.exe` client can connect to a jRDP server.  For now we focus on the server side as there are other projects implementing RDP clients.
